Description: An open-source toolkit designed to advance empirical research in 
    Global Value Chains (GVCs) and trade-environment linkages using Asian 
    Development Bank Multi-Regional Input-Output (ADB MRIO) tables. Implements 
    advanced decomposition frameworks—building on Zhang et al. (2017) and the 
    Wang-Wei-Zhu methodology—to quantify domestic vs. foreign value-added, 
    double-counting terms, and embodied CO2 emissions. Supports analysis across 
    63 economies and 35 sectors (2000–2023). Features a two-track workflow: 
    (1) Rapid 5-part national decomposition, and (2) Detailed bilateral trade 
    accounting. Includes utilities for seamless integration with pre-processed 
    panel data.

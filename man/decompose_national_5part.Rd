\title{National 5-Part GVC Decomposition (Macro Analysis)}
\usage{
decompose_national_5part(mrio_panel, year)
}
\arguments{
\item{mrio_panel}{The list object loaded via \code{\link{load_adb_mrio}}.}

\item{year}{Integer. The specific year to analyze (e.g., 2021).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with the following columns for all 63 countries and 35 sectors:
\describe{
  \item{X_*}{Gross Output decomposition terms.}
  \item{VA_*}{Value Added decomposition terms.}
  \item{E_*}{Embodied CO2 Emission terms.}
  \item{X_Total, VA_Total, E_Total}{The sum of the 5 components for verification.}
}
}
\description{
Performs a national-level decomposition of Gross Output ($X$), Value Added ($VA$), 
and CO2 Emissions ($E$) into 5 components based on the framework by Zhang et al. (2017).
}
\details{
The function decomposes total output for every country-sector into:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Dom_Fin}: Production consumed domestically as final goods.
  \item \strong{Dom_Int}: Production consumed domestically as intermediate goods.
  \item \strong{Exp_Fin}: Exports consumed immediately by the importer (Final Demand).
  \item \strong{Exp_Int}: Intermediate exports absorbed by the direct importer.
  \item \strong{Exp_GVC}: Intermediate exports involved in complex GVCs (re-exports).
}
The function applies a clipping method (\code{pmax(x, 0)}) to handle numerical precision artifacts
common in sparse matrix operations.
